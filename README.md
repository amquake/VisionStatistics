# VisionStatistics
## Directions
- Edit fields at start of `Robot.java`
  - If photon camera is used
  - If limelight is used
  - If custom tag layout is used (otherwise 2023 field)
  - Buffer length in seconds for statistics
- Run project
  - In simulation (Limelight cannot connect networktables to non-team IP)
  - On roborio
- View statistics published to networktables
  - e.g. "Photon Multitag Stats/TranslationStdDevX"
- "Start Log" command button on dashboard to create a .wpilog
